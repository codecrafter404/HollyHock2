# This is a modifyed fork
I've forked (https://github.com/Stellaris-code/hollyhock-fork) for updating the addresses.
The fork isn't marked as it because I've cloned it an created a new repo(GitHub does not have a private Fork feature :( )

# Things I've edited
- Added Utils to Easyer find the addresses in newer versions
- Added TickTackToe to demos

- A PAUSE function to Tetris Demo App (just for comfort)
- Added a draw Programm

# hollyhock
An SDK to write your own applications for the CASIO fx-CP400 graphics calculator.

This is by no means a finished project. Like the disclaimer says, use at your own risk! Breaking changes are not out of the question, and should be 100% expected.

<strike>I (@The6P4C) have burned out *hard* on this project, and won't be maintaining it any further. These tools, patches and SDK work only for OS v02.01.2000.0000. The tools are easily updated, but the patches and SDK are **much** more difficult (and half the reason I'm so burned out).</strike>
I(@Codecrafter404) have updated the SDK and the tools.(To OS v02.01.7001.0000)

<strike>Please contact @ps100000 regarding this project.</strike>
You can contact me via Discord(@Codecrafter_404#6203)

# How to update the SDK
Use my Python Skript and if you need the old firmware updater you can look here: https://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=2680090.
DONT FORGET TO ALSO UPDATE THE PATCHES MANUALLY.
